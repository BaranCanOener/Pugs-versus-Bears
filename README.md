# Pugs-versus-Bears
A chess game based on the engine written for Console Chess (https://github.com/BaranCanOener/ConsoleChess), featuring a GUI using the wxWidgets-framework.

Update April/21: Zobrist key based hashtables Hashtables have been added (see the Hashtable class in board.h), and the engine now activates the king during the endgame; moreover, the engine is much better at avoiding stalemates now. Several minor improvements and bugfixes were made.

A major clean-up of the code would be next on the list - especially the code blocks on alphabeta/quiescence search have quite some redundancy.
