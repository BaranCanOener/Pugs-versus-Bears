# Pugs-versus-Bears
A chess game based on the engine written for Console Chess (https://github.com/BaranCanOener/ConsoleChess), featuring a GUI using the wxWidgets-framework.
Update April/21: Hashtables have been added, and the engine now activates the king during the endgame; moreover, the engine is much better at avoiding stalemates now. Several minor improvements and bugfixes were made.
A major clean-up of the code would be next on the list - especially the code blocks on alphabeta/quiescence search have quite some redundancy.
