# Pugs-versus-Bears
A chess game based on the engine written for Console Chess (https://github.com/BaranCanOener/ConsoleChess), featuring a GUI using the wxWidgets-framework.
The engine is described in the Console Chess repository. Known issues at this point are a weak avoidance of stalemates and stationary tables for positional strength, i.e. no end-/midgame adjustments are currently made to the engine's playstyle.
